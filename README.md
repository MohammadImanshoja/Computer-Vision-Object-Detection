The Brain Tumor Detection Dataset is a dataset fom kaggle which specifically designed for detecting brain tumours using advanced computer vision techniques.
For this task we use a DERT (Detection transformer) model . As this model requires the labels in COCO format , how ever the original labels were in YOLO (You Only Look Once) format . So a seprated label file was created from the labels in YOLO to COCO format. 
The dataset includes 9900 images.
Tumors are annotated originallyin YOLOv9 format.
